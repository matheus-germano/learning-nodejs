# learning-nodejs

This is a simple project which I used to practice basic NodeJS, such as create a project, read and delete them as well.

If you want to run it in your device, follow the steps bellow.

- Create the database through the db.sql file in database folder;
- In client folder (cd client), run `yarn start`;
- In server folder (cd server), run `yarn run devStart`;
